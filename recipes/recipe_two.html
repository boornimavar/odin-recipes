        <h2>For the Carbonara:</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>200g spaghetti</li>
           <li>100g pancetta</li>
           <li>2 large eggs</li>
           <li>50g Pecorino cheese</li>
           <li>50g Parmesan cheese</li>
           <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
           <li>Sea salt</li>
           <li>2 cloves of garlic, peeled</li>
           <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="steps">
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
                <li>Finely chop the pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate both cheeses and mix them together.</li>
                <li>Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper and set everything aside.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
                <li>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
                <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop the butter into a large wide frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</li>
                <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now fulfilled its role and can be discarded.</li>
                <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Do not throw away the pasta water.</li>
                <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
                <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.</li>
                <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy. You don’t want it wet, just moist. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.</li>
            </ol>
